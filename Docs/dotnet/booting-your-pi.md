# Booting your YoshiPi

Insert the SD card you created (insert link)

Power your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

It is not required, but is often helpful at this point to have a monitor connected to your device via HDMI to allow you to see boot progress, monitor any boot errors, and to see the IP address assigned to the device.  If you have difficulties connecting to your device, connect a monitor.

First boot will take a while (~2 minutes).  The device will generate SSH keys, resize your SD card volume and reboot a couple times.  At the end, if all went well, it will come to a login prompt, and just above that prompt will be the DNS-assigned IP address.

At this point, if you assigned a hostname to the device during OS setup, from any PC on your network you should be able to ping the device.

```
> ping -4 yoshipi.local

Pinging yoshipi.local [192.168.4.69] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.4.69: bytes=32 time=3ms TTL=64
```

now, from a terminal on a dev PC, SSH into your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

```
> ssh pi@192.168.4.69
