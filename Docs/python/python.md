# YoshiPi Python Documentation

While the YoshiPi was envisioned and created as a platform to help .NET developers get into IoT development, we also recognize that the hardware is not specifically tied to any specific SDK.  

The Meadow .NET API is very well thought out and intuitive, so we have started an effort to mirror that API in Python in a way that stays true to both the Meadow constructs and Python's syntax.

If you want to assist in this effort, we'd love the help.
